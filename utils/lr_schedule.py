class MipLRDecay(object):
    """
    Continuous learning rate decay function.
        The returned rate is lr_init when step=0 and lr_final when step=max_steps, and
        is log-linearly interpolated elsewhere (equivalent to exponential decay).
        If lr_delay_steps>0 then the learning rate will be scaled by some smooth
        function of lr_delay_mult, such that the initial learning rate is
        lr_init*lr_delay_mult at the beginning of optimization but will be eased back
        to the normal learning rate when steps>lr_delay_steps.
    Args:
        step: int, the current optimization step.
        lr_init: float, the initial learning rate.
        lr_final: float, the final learning rate.
        max_steps: int, the number of steps during optimization.
        lr_delay_steps: int, the number of steps to delay the full learning rate.
        lr_delay_mult: float, the multiplier on the rate when delaying it.
    Returns:
        lr: the learning for current step 'step'.
